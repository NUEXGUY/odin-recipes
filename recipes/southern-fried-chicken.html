<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 pieces of chicken (a mix of drumsticks, thighs, and breasts)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust for heat preference)</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Oil, for frying (traditionally lard or vegetable oil)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, soak the chicken in buttermilk for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, in the refrigerator. This tenderizes the chicken and infuses it with flavor.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat your oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. You want it around 350°F (175°C) for optimal frying.</li>
        <li>Take each piece of buttermilk-soaked chicken and dredge it in the flour mixture, ensuring it's thoroughly coated. Tap off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the chicken pieces into the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until it's golden brown and cooked through. Thicker pieces like breasts may take a bit longer.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken rest for a few minutes, then serve hot with your favorite sides and enjoy the taste of the South!</li>
